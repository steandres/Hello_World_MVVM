# MVVM - Hello World (Model-View-ViewModel)

This project demonstrates the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern using Python in a simple console environment.

## ðŸ§  What is MVVM?

MVVM is a software architectural pattern that separates application logic into three components:

- **Model**: Represents the application's data (in this case, the message "Hello World").
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It prepares the data in a way that the View can consume easily.
- **View**: Responsible for displaying the data. In this example, it prints the message to the console.

This separation allows better maintainability, testability, and scalability in real applications (especially in GUI apps or web frameworks).

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
cd mvvm
python main.py
